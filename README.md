File Deleter
=========

File Deleter is a desktop application that deletes files in specific folders on Linux and OSX. 

All options are currently working 
  1. Choosing Directory for deleting files
  2. Choosing or typing file type
  3. Delete button to delete files
  4. Option to delete files based on last modified date

I am currently working on it every so often to include features that make it more convenient and effective.
