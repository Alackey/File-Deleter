File Deleter

File Deleter is a desktop application that deletes files in specific folders.

Instructions:
1. Choose a directory for the file you want deleted.
2. Choose the file type you want deleted.
3. If you want to choose a date for last modified, choose that next.
4. (NO REVERSING THIS)Press delete.

All options are currently working

Choosing Directory for deleting files
Choosing or typing file type

I am currently working on it every so often to include features that make it more convenient and effective.
